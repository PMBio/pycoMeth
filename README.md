**DNA methylation analysis downstream to Nanopolish for Oxford Nanopore DNA sequencing datasets**

`pycoMeth` can be used for further analyses starting from the output files generated by [`Nanopolish call-methylation`](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish). The package contains a suite of tools to **find CpG islands**, **segment methylome**, and to perform a **differential methylation analysis** across multiple samples.

`pycoMeth` generates extensive tabulated reports and BED files which can be loaded in a genome browser. In addition, an interactive HTML report of differentially
methylated intervals/islands can also generated at the end of the analysis.

[`Methplotlib`](https://github.com/wdecoster/methplotlib) developed by [Wouter de coster](https://twitter.com/wouter_decoster) is an excellent complementary tool to visualise and explore methylation status for specific loci.

Please be aware that `pycoMeth` is a research package that is still under development. The API, command line interface, and implementation might change without retro-compatibility.
